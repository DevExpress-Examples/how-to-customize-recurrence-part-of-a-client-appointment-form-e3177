<p>This example illustrates how to customize some recurrence elements of a client recurrence form:</p><p>- The default selection in the WeeklyRecurrenceControl is made only for specific days. Weekends are hidden.<br />
- The "No end date" option is removed.<br />
- The Max value of Days and Occurrences spin edits is limited.</p><p>Refer to the "~/UserForms/ScriptRecurrenceForm.ascx" and "~/Default.aspx" markup files to learn more (see the corresponding comments in the JS code).</p><p>Note that this example is based on the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E1547">How to implement a client-side appointment editing form with custom fields</a> example.</p><p>Also, we are going to implement the capability to customize the server recurrence form controls in the context of the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/S31460">Appointment Recurrence Form - Provide the capability to customize the form</a> suggestion.</p>
